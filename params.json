{"name":"CppStyle","tagline":"","body":"CppStyle\r\n========================\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wangzw/cppstyle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wangzw/cppstyle)\r\n\r\n**An eclipse plugin that integrate clang-format as an alternative c/c++ code formatter and check c++ coding style with cpplint.py**\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nA consistent coding style is important for a project. And many projects use tools to format the code and check coding style. Many developers use eclipse as a c/c++ IDE, but it is a little difficult to integrate an external tool to eclipse. People have to switch to a command line and run the tools to format the code and check coding style. And switch back to eclipse to find the line and fix the coding style issue based on the tool's output. For the \"lazy\" people like me, it is irritating. \r\n\r\nThe expected behavious is that people just format the code fragment by first select it and then press \"command + shift + f\" on MacOS or \"ctrl + shift + f\" on other system. And further more, run the coding style checker on save and mark all issues on the editor. That is exactly what CppStyle does.\r\n\r\nThere are many c/c++ code format tools such as \"[astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/)\" but currently **\"[clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)\"** is my favorite. It has several pre-defined styles and is highly configurable.\r\n\r\n**[cpplint.py](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#cpplint)** is a c++ coding style checker provided by google. It can be used to check the c++ code against the [google c++ coding style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html). It can detect many style errors and keep the consistency of coding style.\r\n\r\n## Requirement\r\n    cpplint.py     http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#cpplint\r\n    clang-format   http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html\r\n\r\n### Install cpplint.py on Linux/MacOS\r\n\r\n    sudo curl -L \"http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py\" -o /usr/bin/cpplint.py\r\n    sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/cpplint.py\r\n\r\n### Install clang-format on Linux/MacOS\r\nclanf-format can be built from llvm/clang source. But installing from binary is much easier.\r\n\r\nFor Ubuntu\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install clang-format-3.4\r\n    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/clang-format-3.4 /usr/bin/clang-format\r\n\r\nOn 64 bit platform, clang-format can also be downloaded from this [page](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Clang%20Format).\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, you can download the [entire LLVM toolchain](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html) and extract the clang-format binary yourself. Just extract the .tar.xz file and copy bin/clang-format into your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin). - Set the path to the clang-format binaries. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nCppStyle can be installed like other eclipse plugins from this site (case sensitive).\r\n\r\n    http://wangzw.github.io/CppStyle/update\r\n\r\n## Configure CppStyle\r\n\r\nTo configure CppStyle globally, go to **eclipse -> preferences -> CppStyle** page\r\n\r\nTo configure CppSytle for a c/c++ project, go to **project properties -> CppStyle** page.\r\n\r\nTo enable CppStyle(clang-format) as default c/c++ code formatter, go to **eclipse ->  preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style -> Formatter** page and switch **\"Code Formatter\"** from **[built-in]** to **\"CppStyle (clang-format)\"**\r\n\r\nTo enable CppStyle(clang-format) as c/c++ code formatter for a project, go to **project properties -> C/C++ General -> Formatter** page and switch **\"Code Formatter\"** from **[built-in]** to **\"CppStyle (clang-format)\"**\r\n\r\n## Configure clang-format\r\n\r\nCppStyle does not support changing the command line parameter for both clang-format and cpplint.py. So using confgure file to configure them is the only but the best way.\r\n\r\nCppStyle will pass the source file's full absolute path to clang-format in command line. And clang-format will try to find the configure file named **.clang-format** in the source file's path, and its parent's path if not found previously, and parent's path of the parent and so on.\r\n\r\nSo put the conigure file **.clang-format** into the project's root direcotry can make it work for all source files in the project.\r\n\r\nFurther more, you can also add the configure file **.clang-format** into eclipse workspace root directory to make it work for all projects in the workspace.\r\n\r\nTo generate clang-format configure file **.clang-format**\r\n\r\n    clang-format -dump-config -style=Google > .clang-format\r\n\r\n**If no configure file named .clang-format is found, \"-style=Google\" will be passed to clang-format and Google style will be used by default.**\r\n\r\n## Configure cpplint.py\r\n\r\nCppStyle will pass **--root=project_root_dir** and source file's full absolute path to cpplint.py in the command line. And cpplint.py also supports per-directory configurations by the configure file named CPPLINT.cfg.\r\n\r\nCPPLINT.cfg file can contain a number of key=value pairs.\r\n    Currently the following options are supported:\r\n\r\n      set noparent\r\n      filter=+filter1,-filter2,...\r\n      exclude_files=regex\r\n      linelength=80\r\n\r\nTo get the details of these options you can run the command:\r\n\r\n    cpplint.py --help\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
